# Forecast

The immediate task for this project is to create the reasonable clear methodology for estimation of rebates and commissions payable for the forecasting period (up to 12 months going forward).
Broader area of implementation of the roadmap that will be created and tested within this project is estimation of potentially every item of the balance sheet of the company.

The project was accomplished in twice.

Initial attempt was done for the business model with five manufacturing facilities. Catalyst Paper changed its structure making acquisition of two manufacturing units in US. In order to decrease/avoid noise historical data sample used for analysis taken for the period from 2015 to 2017. As a result of that project the regression model with pretty high predictive power (R2=0.80) generated regression coefficients and future rebates&commissions balances were estimated in Excel using regression equation.

At the middle of 2018 company will change its structure by selling two facilities in US previously acquired in 2015. That significant event requires revisit of the problem of estimation of rebates commissions balances and reconsider methodology and optimal solution for future estimations. The historical data sample extended for the period from 2008 to 2017.
