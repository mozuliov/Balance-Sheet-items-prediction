Catalyst Paper produces diverse paper which it sales to retailers, publishers and commercial printers both through it own sales team and through the external agents. External agents have an advantage of being paid rebates periodically. Amounts of rebates are significant and being paid periodically (monthly, quarterly, etc.) make sufficient accrualed balances at the end of each period. So it perfectly make sence to estimate those balances of accrued and unpaid rebates for the purpose of cash flow management.
